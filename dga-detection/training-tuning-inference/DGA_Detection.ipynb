    "## Introduction\n",
    "[Domain Generation Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_generation_algorithm) (DGAs) are used to generate domain names that can be used by the malware to communicate with the command and control servers. IP addresses and static domain names can be easily blocked, and a DGA provides an easy method to generate a large number of domain names and rotate through them to circumvent traditional block lists. We will use a type of recurrent neural network called the [Gated Recurrent Unit](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21) (GRU) for this example. This implementation enables users to train their models with up-to-date domain names representative of both benign and DGA generated strings. This capability could also be used in production. This notebook provides a view into the data science workflow to create a DGA detection implementation."

    "This DGA detection implementation enables users to train their models for detection and also use existing models. This capability could also be used in conjunction with log parsing efforts if the logs contain domain names. Data is kept in GPU memory, removing unnecessary copy/converts and providing a 4X speed advantage over CPU only implementations. This is esepcially true with large batch sizes."
